Run the Data Quality Analysis Next.js app (dev)

From PowerShell, WSL, or Git Bash in Windows, change into the app folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Launchpad8/Next.js test/data-analysis-tutorial/data-analysis-tutorial"
npm install
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to see the Upload page. If you previously started a different project in another folder (for example `brayden`), make sure you run the commands in this `data-analysis-tutorial` folder so the new `src/app` files are served.
